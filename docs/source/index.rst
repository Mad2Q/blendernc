**BlenderNC** is a Blender add-on that allows to import netCDF files into 
Blender. It allows 2D and 3D visualization and generation of scientific data 
animations. The main development of *BlenderNC* is currently focus in 
geo-spatial data (i.e. Oceanographic - Atmospheric data), however, the framework 
should support the load of any netCDF.
