==================
Import ECMWF cGrib
==================

.. important::
    It is important to be familiar with the BlenderNC nodetree (:ref:`pro_mode`) to follow this tutorial.


Some data has been provided by ECMWF, and it is included at the main `BlenderNC <https://github.com/blendernc/blendernc>`_ repository in the path ``blendernc/test/dataset``.

::

    blendernc
    └── tests
        └── dataset
            ├── ECMWF_data.grib
            ├── ECMWF_data.nc
            ├── ssh_1995-01.nc
            └── ssh_1995-01.zarr

This example will use the file ``ECMWF_data.grib``.
