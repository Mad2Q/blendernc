# GeoNodes

**GeoNodes** a [**Blender**](www.blender.org) Add-on to import geo-scientific data as images.

It allows to transparently use **netCDF** data files as images inside Blender.

Tested with data with 1400x700 points it is fast enough to produce animations in real-time,
which can make this tool useful not only for producing stunning animations but also for data exploration purposes.
