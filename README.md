**BlenderNC** is a [**Blender**](www.blender.org) Add-on to visualise **netCDF** data.

It allows to transparently use **netCDF** data files as images inside Blender.

Tested with data with 1400x700 points it is fast enough to produce animations in real-time,
which can make this tool useful not only for producing stunning animations but also for data exploration purposes.
